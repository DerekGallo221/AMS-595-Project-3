Most codes will only need to be run for it to work. 
Entering factorial(n) with any non-zero digit for n will return n!
prime(n) will return if it is true that n is prime or false that it isn't, and prime_factors(n) will return a list of that number's prime factors.
pascal(n) and pascal_by_loops(n) will both return the nth row of Pascal's Triangle
